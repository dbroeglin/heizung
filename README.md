## Introduction
Heating visualization is a tool that read/write values from a Waterkotte heating with a WPCU.C attached.
Values are visualized on a webpage and some values can even be changed from the website.

### Technology
Values are stored in a mysql database, even if you write values to the heating.

The webinterface is based on ZendFramework2, jQuery, PHP and Doctrine2.
The backend is written in C and Perl and is using libmodbus.

### Installation
Clone the repository using git.
